# More About Me
An amateur gamer: Heartstone(monthly legend player), Dota2(12-year "old" rookie), Civilization VI(early-game warmonger).

I am a big fan of football, and my favorite team is Real Madrid. I also really enjoy Chinese crosstalk(相声) or classic music while working. I would describe myself as a very amateur saxophone player.
